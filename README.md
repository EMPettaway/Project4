### Python
I am recreating the classic game "Snake" using Python (get it?).  Ultimately I would like this to be an educational game that can be used to teach the alphabet, where the 'snake' eats letters in the correct order.  I plan to use python for the backend and HTML for the front end.

### MVP

- Welcome page explaining the rules of the game as well as the controls.

- Game page where a user plays the game.

- High score page to view high scores.

### Stretch Goals

- User can customize controls

- Two player funtionality

- Different unlockable 'skins' for player's chracter.

- Add background music to game

- Add ability to customize game board

### Front-End

- Django

### Back-End

- Python

### User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to view the rules and controls of the game.

- As a user I want to be able to play the game.

- As a user I want to be able to view high scores.
